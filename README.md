# Machine Learning Instrument Recognition
Project for the course Machine Learning in which we attempt to create a neural network for instrument recognition in audio

# Acknowledgements
This project is built upon using the IRMAS dataset created by Bosh et al. and is only used for academic purposes

# Set up
To run the networks, first download the IRMAS dataset from https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/irmas and unzip everything in the data directory.
